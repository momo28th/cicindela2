#summary README

== checkout cicindela ==

{{{
 cd /home
 svn checkout http://cicindela2.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ cicindela
}}}
Program runs directly on the working directory. No installation scripts (currently). 

Cicindela assumes *project root dir = /home/cicindela* and *perl binary = /usr/bin/perl*, and are hard coded in the source codes.

If you happen to have checked out the source code in directories other than '/home/cicindela', or have perl installed somewhere other than '/usr/bin/perl', there still is a work around.

The script 'misc/substitute_project_paths.pl' can search and replace all occurences of those paths in-place. (yes, we know it's absurd)
{{{
 cd misc
 perl substitute_project_paths.pl --perl-path=/usr/local/bin/perl --cicindela_home=/where/you/have/checkedout/cicindela
}}}

== install mysql (>=5.0)  ==

 * http://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/5.1.html

== configure mysql  ==

cicindela and mysql's local conf paths may be different depending on your installation.

    install Time::Piece; install Log::Log4perl;
    intall Module::Pluggable; install Class::Singleton;" 
}}}
